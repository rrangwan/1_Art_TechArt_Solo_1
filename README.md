## Concept:
“Under the Weight of Eternity” is an installation that brings to life a poem I wrote specifically
for this exhibition. The goal is to elicit feelings of awe for nature and creation while
simultaneously expressing the futility of patterns and existence.

The poem will be presented in its original English version as well as in Arabic as translated by
Nujoom Al Ghanem. The English version is here:

“We are hostages to the continuous and repetitive laws that govern the universe;
we are made of bondages, sometimes forced sometimes by choice, as with quantum neurons.
The universal patterns never end, while the witnesses turn to dust.”
