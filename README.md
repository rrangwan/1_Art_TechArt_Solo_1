## Concept:
“Under the Weight of Eternity” is an installation that brings to life a poem I wrote specifically
for this exhibition. The goal is to elicit feelings of awe for nature and creation while
simultaneously expressing the futility of patterns and existence.

“We are hostages to the continuous and repetitive laws that govern the universe;
we are made of bondages, sometimes forced sometimes by choice, as with quantum neurons.
The universal patterns never end, while the witnesses turn to dust.”

Linked (by QR) is a webpage replicating the IBM NLP analysis of the poem. 
The itention is to bring in AI to the conversation; so as to add to the sense of patterns and 
futility through the added dimension of competition from Artificial Intelligence.
